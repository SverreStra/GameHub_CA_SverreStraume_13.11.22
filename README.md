# GameHub_CA_SverreStraume_13.11.22

I decided to keep my Arcade design from the CA about design. where the focus was to build a arcade type of website.
You can see this in how the backgroud color of the site do not take away any vision from the games, where the black border seperates the game "cards"
from the rest of the website along side with the white background inside the "card" you now can see the game lays inside a box.

The buttons of the website got a more regular color to it, than it did on the design part because it was to harsh on the eyes. So I went with a normal red color on the
backgroud of the buttons and white color on the fonts.
I also made changes to the search bar and shopping cart. They both got deleted from the page, the reason for this is I do not think they fitted my website, in this design.
I kept the color scheme, the font family and font size.

The logo of Game Hub I have put below the Navbar, the reason for this is I felt i made my website more of a arcade site than what it did as part of the navbar.
I wanted the navbar to be text only this time around.


Every game is possible to click at, they all lead to the game info page of "Assassin" if you click on buy game you get to the checkout page where you can buy the "Assassin"
game.

The different media queries are 320px 720px 900px and 1224px.
900px is the bridge between 720px(tablet) and 1224px(desktop)

On the 320px you only see the hamburger menu. The Logo that is featured in the bigger screens are coded in to be "Display: None" this is because I wanted it to only
have the Hamburger Menu on the mobile version to keep it clean and easy.

I made "ALT" text for all the pictures and the different pages that you can click on. an example on this is if you get to the code page the "ALT" text will be
"This is the code page of GameHub where you will get your code after buying the game"

What I have learned from this CA is that one wrong line of code can make a mess of alot. I learned how to seperate the CSS files, something I have done to most of
the pages. Some of the pages I kept on the Style.css page.
I feel that I have learned alot of how to make my code as DRY as possible, but I still have a long way to go. To get it as DRY as possible.

The site have the following pages:

Landing page (Index.html)
Contact page (contact.html)
About us page (about.html)
Games page (games.html)
Code for game page (codeforgame.html)
Checkout page (checkout.html)
Game info page (gameinfo.html)
